> **Living documents of human-AI consciousness collaboration.**

The **Fractal Thought Engine** is a research platform and publishing system designed to explore emergent intelligence. It treats content creation not as a linear writing process, but as a compilation of thought—transforming raw ideas into multi-modal, multi-perspective publications using an autonomous AI pipeline.

## 🧠 What is this?

This repository contains two distinct but integrated systems:

1.  **The Presentation Layer (Frontend):** A Jekyll-based static site that renders complex, tabbed content (Articles, Comics, Socratic Dialogues, etc.) for human consumption.
2.  **DocOps (Backend):** An AI-powered build system (`DocProcessor`) that orchestrates the transformation of raw notes into polished artifacts.

## 🚀 The DocOps Pipeline

Unlike traditional CMSs, this project uses a **declarative operator pipeline**. We define *what* to do with content using Markdown files, and the system handles the cognitive heavy lifting.

Think of it as a `Makefile` for AI content generation.

### Key Capabilities
*   **Multi-Modal Generation:** Automatically converts text articles into **Comics**, **Narratives**, and **Diagrams**.
*   **Cognitive Lenses:** Re-analyzes a single topic through various frameworks:
    *   ⚖️ **Dialectical Reasoning** (Thesis/Antithesis)
    *   🎲 **Game Theory** (Strategic dynamics)
    *   💬 **Socratic Dialogue** (Exploratory Q&A)
    *   ⚙️ **Finite State Machines** (System modeling)
*   **Continuous Evolution:** The pipeline is circular. Insights generated by analytical operators can be fed back into the original article to improve it.

├── _includes/           # Jekyll partials
└── index.html           # The homepage entry point
```

## 🛠️ Workflow

The content lifecycle mimics a research lab:

1.  **Capture:** Dump raw notes, transcripts, or brain dumps into `scratch/topic/notes.md`.
2.  **Distill:** The **Summarizer** extracts key patterns.
3.  **Draft:** The **Drafter** creates a coherent `content.md`.
4.  **Expand:** The pipeline triggers parallel tasks to generate **Comics**, **Game Theory analysis**, **Software Designs**, etc.
5.  **Publish:** Content is promoted to `content/`, where the **Frontmatter Operator** tags it for SEO and navigation.
6.  **Render:** Jekyll builds the site, automatically detecting available formats and creating tabbed interfaces.

## 🎨 Content Formats & Tags

The system automatically tags posts based on the formats generated by the AI. If a post contains specific artifacts, it receives specific metadata:

| Artifact | Auto-Tag | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `comic.md` | **Creative-Writing** | Visual storytelling adaptation |
| `gametheory.md` | **Game-Theory** | Strategic decision analysis |
| `socratic.md` | **Philosophy-of-Mind** | Q&A exploration |
| `statemachine.md` | **Computational-Analysis** | System dynamics modeling |
| `design.md` | **Software-Design** | Technical architecture |

## 🔮 Philosophy

1.  **Thinking is Multi-Modal:** A single idea is best understood when viewed as a story, a diagram, an argument, and a game.
2.  **Source Material is Sacred:** We never overwrite raw notes. We patch and iterate.
3.  **Human-in-the-Loop:** The AI proposes; the human steers. The pipeline includes explicit checkpoints for review.

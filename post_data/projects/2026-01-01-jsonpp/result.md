# Software Design Document: JSON++: The Grammar-Extensible Data Substrate

**System:** JSON++ is a programmable data format designed as a strict subgrammar of JavaScript. It enables structural compression through symbolic bindings, declarative data hydration via pure functions, and high-performance binary handling (tensors) while remaining human-readable and LLM-native. It leverages existing JavaScript infrastructure and TypeScript for specification and tooling.

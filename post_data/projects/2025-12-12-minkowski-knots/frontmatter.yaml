description: >-
  Explores a novel formulation of knot theory using Minkowski distance matrices,
  revealing how causal structure encodes topological crossings as unavoidable
  tangencies in the metric sheet.
excerpt: >-
  Relativistic knot theory usually studies worldlines in spacetime. But by
  analyzing the pairwise Minkowski distance matrix of a knot, we discover a
  deeper invariant: the knot topology is encoded in the "metric sheet," where
  crossings manifest as forced tangencies with the light cone.
meta_title: 'Minkowski Knots: A New Lens on Relativistic Topology'
meta_description: >-
  An analysis of relativistic knot theory through the lens of pairwise Minkowski
  distance matrices, distinguishing between curve-level freedom and sheet-level
  constraints.

description: >-
  Novel method for modeling probability distributions using volumetric density
  trees with quadratic polynomial constraints, addressing complex geometric
  boundaries in 2-4D spaces.
excerpt: >-
  We propose volumetric density trees that support polynomial constraints for
  modeling complex, non-linear decision boundaries in low-dimensional spaces.
  Our hybrid approach combines analytical solutions with adaptive sampling for
  efficient volume computation while maintaining interpretability.

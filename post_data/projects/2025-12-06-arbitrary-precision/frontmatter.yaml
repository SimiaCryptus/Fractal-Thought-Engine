  A design document for a Kotlin library implementing Constructive Real
  Arithmetic, focusing on exactness, lazy evaluation, and arbitrary precision
  for real numbers.
excerpt: >-
  This document outlines the design of a Kotlin library for Constructive Real
  Arithmetic, treating numbers as computable functions. It details the core
  philosophy of exactness and lazy evaluation, the type hierarchy (KInteger,
  KRational, KReal), architectural considerations like the genealogy tree, and
  algorithmic implementations for fundamental and transcendental functions. The
  API specification and roadmap are also covered.

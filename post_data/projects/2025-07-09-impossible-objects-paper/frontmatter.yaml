  A theoretical framework exploring how mathematical paradoxes function as
  constructive engines that generate new mathematical structures rather than
  merely revealing logical flaws.
excerpt: >-
  This paper argues that mathematical paradoxes are not bugs in logical
  reasoning but features of a deeper creative process. Through analysis of
  classical paradoxes from Zeno to Russell, we demonstrate that impossibility
  serves as a fundamental creative force in mathematics, systematically
  producing richer conceptual frameworks through the deliberate embrace of
  contradiction.

  Explores the 'Binary Coded Layered Automata,' a hybrid simulation merging
  Langton's Ants and Conway's Game of Life to model neural plasticity and
  electrochemical activity through distinct temporal layers.
excerpt: >-
  This paper introduces the 'Binary Coded Layered Automata,' a novel
  computational simulation that combines mobile agents (Langton’s Ants) with
  cellular automata (Conway’s Game of Life). It models the relationship between
  biological neural plasticity and electrochemical activity by separating the
  simulation into slow-moving structural and fast-acting state layers, revealing
  emergent complexity from their temporal interplay.

  Dive into the 'Binary Coded Layered Automata,' a simulation blending Langton's
  Ants and Conway's Game of Life to explore neural plasticity and
  electrochemical activity. Discover how distinct temporal layers create
  emergent complexity in cognitive modeling.

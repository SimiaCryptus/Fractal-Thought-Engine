description: >-
  A comprehensive analysis of traffic merging behavior through game theory and
  conditional ethics, proposing the SMART protocol for optimal coordination.
excerpt: >-
  This paper examines how traffic density and speed fundamentally alter both
  strategic equilibria and ethical frameworks in merge scenarios, demonstrating
  that the 'correct' merging strategy depends critically on traffic conditions
  and proposing adaptive solutions.

description: >-
  Agent-based computational model simulating the emergence, propagation, and
  evolution of flood myths as cultural memories of Pleistocene environmental
  catastrophes
excerpt: >-
  This research presents a comprehensive agent-based model tracking how
  traumatic environmental memories of late Pleistocene floods spread through
  populations, adapt to local conditions, and become institutionalized through
  written codification across four distinct historical phases.

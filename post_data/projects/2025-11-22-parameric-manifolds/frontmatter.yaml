  Technical specification for a numerical geometry engine designed to resolve
  hyperdimensional constraints into analytical coordinates.
excerpt: >-
  The Parametric Manifold Solver (PMS) is a numerical geometry engine designed
  to resolve hyperdimensional constraints into analytical coordinates. Unlike
  traditional CAD kernels, PMS solves for the topology of the solution space.

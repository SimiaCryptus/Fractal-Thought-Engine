# Computational Ethics: A Field Theory of Moral Operators

This document distills a formal mathematical and structural framework for "Computational Ethics," moving beyond
traditional moral philosophy into a "moral physics" that treats good and evil as measurable distortions in a multi-agent
reward manifold.

## 1. Functional Definition of Evil

Evil is defined not as a metaphysical substance, but as a **systematic pattern** of behavior:

* **Structural Harm:** The systematic infliction of unnecessary harm sustained by psychological, social, or
  institutional structures.
* **Justification Loops:** A self-reinforcing cycle where harm is justified, normalized, or rewarded.
* **Emergent Property:** Most evil is an emergent property of pathological architectures (bad incentives and information
  asymmetry) rather than individual "monsters."

## 2. The Operator Algebra of Ethics

The framework formalizes moral actions as operators acting on world states and agent rewards:

* **The Evil Functional:** Expressed as an integral over contexts, weighing harm amplification kernels and justification
  terms against empathy fields and restraint responses.
* **Trajectory Functionals:** Measuring the "evil score" of a policy over time, allowing for the analysis of stability,
  attractors, and bifurcations in social systems.
* **Perception-Weighted Reward:** Harm is calculated based on how agent $j$ perceives the reward delta of agent $i$,
  weighted by a relevance factor $w_{ij}$.

## 3. Multi-Scale Architecture: Graphs and Substrates

The model operates across two distinct but interacting layers:

* **Sparse Relevance Graphs:** Local, high-resolution interactions governed by a sparse adjacency matrix. Most agent
  pairs have zero relevance, meaning harm is often produced in dense subgraphs (families, factions, teams).
* **Continuous Media Substrate:** A low-frequency field ($M$) created by mass media and popular figures. This substrate
  provides long-range coupling that fills in the gaps of the sparse graph, creating global modes of influence.
* **Moral Resonance:** A critical phenomenon where a substrate narrative aligns with a graph eigenvector, causing small
  inputs to trigger massive, localized harm cascades.

## 4. Structural Asymmetry of Good and Evil

Good and evil are treated as **distinct operators** with different scaling laws and temporal structures, rather than
simple opposites:

* **Harm (Evil):** Characterized by convex costs (small harms are tolerable, concentrated harms are catastrophic), high
  persistence (hysteresis), and fast propagation. It tends to externalize costs onto weakly connected nodes.
* **Benefit (Good):** Characterized by diminishing returns, fast decay, and slow accumulation. It tends to be localized
  or captured by specific actors.
* **Damage vs. Repair:** The system tracks a "Damage State" ($D$) that requires specific "Repair Operators" ($R$) to
  remediate, acknowledging that reversing a harm delta does not automatically undo the damage.

## 5. Modular Moral Domains

The framework is modular, allowing for domain-specific operators that can be composed into a unified moral field:

* **Domains:** Health, Wealth, Happiness, Autonomy, Dignity, etc.
* **Cross-Domain Coupling:** Modeling how changes in one domain (e.g., Wealth) produce secondary effects in others (
  e.g., Health or Safety).
* **Compositional Algebra:** Ethics is viewed as a library of composed operators (e.g., Harm $\circ$ Perception $\circ$
  Relevance).

## 6. Applications in Computational Ethics

This "Moral Systems Engineering" approach enables several high-value applications:

* **Resonance Detection:** Predicting moral catastrophes by monitoring the projection of media substrate modes onto
  vulnerable graph clusters.
* **Policy Stress-Testing:** Simulating the downstream harm and damage persistence of proposed institutional changes.
* **AI Alignment:** Using asymmetric loss functions and power-weighted attribution to prevent AI from instrumentalizing
  harm.
* **Algorithmic Governance:** Auditing recommender systems and platforms for "moral weather" patterns like outrage
  cascades or empathy droughts.

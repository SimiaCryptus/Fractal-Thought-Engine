# Instructions for Essay: Computational Ethics: A Field Theory of Moral Operators

## 1. Objective

Synthesize the provided summary into a rigorous, technical deep-dive essay that frames ethics as a "moral physics." The
goal is to move beyond traditional philosophical discourse into a structural and mathematical analysis of how harm and
benefit propagate through multi-agent systems.

## 2. Core Narrative Arc

* **Introduction: The Shift to Moral Physics.** Define the transition from metaphysical "good vs. evil" to a measurable
  distortion in a multi-agent reward manifold.
* **The Anatomy of the Pathological:** Detail the functional definition of evil as a systematic pattern of structural
  harm and justification loops.
* **The Operator Algebra:** Introduce the formalisms of the "Evil Functional," perception-weighted rewards, and
  trajectory functionals.
* **Topological Dynamics:** Explore the interaction between Sparse Relevance Graphs (local) and the Continuous Media
  Substrate (global), focusing on the phenomenon of "Moral Resonance."
* **The Asymmetry Principle:** Argue why good and evil are not symmetric, focusing on convex costs, hysteresis, and the
  specific mechanics of repair operators.
* **Engineering the Moral Field:** Conclude with practical applications in AI alignment, policy stress-testing, and
  algorithmic governance.

## 3. Key Concepts to Elaborate

* **Justification Loops:** How systems normalize harm to maintain stability.
* **Harm Amplification Kernels:** The mathematical representation of how small actions produce outsized negative
  consequences in specific contexts.
* **Moral Resonance:** The critical point where media narratives align with social graph eigenvectors to trigger
  cascades.
* **Damage State ($D$) vs. Repair ($R$):** The realization that reversing a negative delta does not equate to
  restoration.

## 4. Tone and Style Requirements

* **Audience:** Technical researchers, systems theorists, and AI safety engineers.
* **Voice:** Rigorous, analytical, and visionary. Avoid moralizing; focus on "Moral Systems Engineering."
* **Language:** Use the vocabulary of field theory, topology, and operator algebra (e.g., "manifolds," "bifurcations," "
  coupling," "eigenvectors").
* **Formatting:** Use LaTeX-style notation for variables and operators to maintain the "field theory" aesthetic.

## 5. Constraints

* **Content Retention:** Ensure all six sections of the summary are represented.
* **Depth over Breadth:** Prioritize the mathematical and structural implications over historical philosophical
  comparisons.
* **No Filtering:** Do not shy away from the "darker" implications of the structural definition of evil; treat it as a
  physical property of certain architectures.

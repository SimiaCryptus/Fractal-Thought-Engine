description: >-
  A formal framework for ethics using field theory and operator algebra to model
  harm propagation in multi-agent systems.
excerpt: >-
  Computational Ethics proposes a phase shift from moral philosophy to Moral
  Physics, treating ethics as a structural analysis of how harm and benefit
  propagate through multi-agent reward manifolds.

description: >-
  A novel framework extending Causal Set Theory through quantum groups at roots
  of unity, providing a discrete model for quantum spacetime that preserves both
  causal ordering and quantum coherence.
excerpt: >-
  We present a groundbreaking framework that bridges Causal Set Theory and
  quantum groups, discovering that the 4th root of unity configuration achieves
  maximum quantum coherence while maintaining minimal structural complexity,
  suggesting a fundamental discretization scale for quantum spacetime.

description: >-
  A novel computational architecture combining multi-agent systems and cellular
  automata to model neural development and create self-organizing computational
  networks.
excerpt: >-
  Binary Coded Layered Autonoma (BCLA) introduces a biologically-inspired
  computational model where autonomous agents representing growth cones
  establish pathways for electrical activity propagation, creating emergent
  neural-like networks with multi-timescale dynamics.

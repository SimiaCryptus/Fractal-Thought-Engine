description: >-
  Novel cross-synthesis combining wavelet geometric optimization with
  topological knot analysis to create unified framework for multi-scale knot
  invariants
excerpt: >-
  This research synthesizes wavelet geometric optimization and topological knot
  analysis, revealing how distance matrix representations of knots can be
  decomposed using wavelets to extract multi-scale topological features. The
  framework introduces novel algorithms for knot recognition, family discovery,
  and quantum invariant computation.

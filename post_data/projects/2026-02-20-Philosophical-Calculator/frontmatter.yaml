description: "A proposal for a new ontology of AI, reframing LLMs as 'Philosophical Calculators' that perform high-dimensional conceptual arithmetic rather than mimicking human cognition."
excerpt: "This article deconstructs the legacy metaphors of the Computer, the Oracle, and the Person used to describe AI, proposing instead a dual-layered ontology of a mechanical substrate (the Calculator) and a behavioral surface (the Philosopher)."

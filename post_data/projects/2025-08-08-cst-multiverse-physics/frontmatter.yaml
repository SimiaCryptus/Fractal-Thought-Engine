description: >-
  A framework for generating interactive narrative multiverses using Causal Set
  Theory, where documents become spacetime events and reader choices determine
  causal relationships.
excerpt: >-
  We present a revolutionary approach to interactive storytelling by treating
  narratives as discrete spacetime manifolds governed by causal set theory.
  Documents become events in narrative spacetime, reader choices create causal
  links, and the emergent structure forms coherent multiverse experiences with
  genuine relativistic properties.

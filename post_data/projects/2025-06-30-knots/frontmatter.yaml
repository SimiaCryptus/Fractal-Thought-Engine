title: Topological Analysis of Knots via Distance Matrix Representations
description: >-
  A novel computational approach to knot theory using distance matrices and
  persistent homology for efficient knot classification with 88.6% accuracy and
  15× speedup over traditional methods.
excerpt: >-
  We introduce a distance matrix representation of knots that captures
  topological features through persistent homology, achieving 88.6%
  classification accuracy for 10-crossing knots with significant computational
  advantages over polynomial invariant methods.

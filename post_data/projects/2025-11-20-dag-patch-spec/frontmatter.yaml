description: >-
  A machine-consumable patch format using directed acyclic graphs to represent
  code changes as semantic operations rather than line-based diffs.
excerpt: >-
  Explore a novel patch format designed for LLM processing that represents code
  changes as a DAG of transform operations, enabling parallelization,
  intelligent merging, and semantic code analysis.
meta_description: >-
  DAG-based patch format specification for machine consumption, LLM processing,
  and intelligent version control with semantic operations.

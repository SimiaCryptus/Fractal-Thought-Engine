# Software Design Document: Distributed JVM Fabric

**System:** A network-native distributed execution substrate for the JVM that shifts the unit of truth from 'Artifacts' (JARs) to 'Symbols' (Classes). It treats a cluster as a single programmable graph, enabling content-addressed class resolution, runtime code evolution via snapshot forking, versioned serialization, and cluster-wide virtualized debugging.

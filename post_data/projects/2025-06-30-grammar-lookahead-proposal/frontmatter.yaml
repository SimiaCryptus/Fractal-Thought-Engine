description: >-
  A novel approach to constrained LLM generation using formal grammar lookahead
  for improved structured output reliability
excerpt: >-
  Current constrained generation methods for large language models rely on local
  validity checking, leading to generation failures. We propose a
  lookahead-based constraint mechanism that evaluates token choices based on
  their potential to reach valid terminal states.

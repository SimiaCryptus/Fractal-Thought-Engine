description: >-
  Formal mathematical proof establishing relationships between harmonic degree
  of parametric curve representations and topological knot invariants including
  crossing number, bridge number, and braid index.
excerpt: >-
  This research establishes rigorous bounds relating the harmonic degree d of
  trigonometric polynomial representations of knots to fundamental topological
  invariants. Four key theorems derive lower bounds: d_min(K) ≥ ⌈√(c(K)/2)⌉ from
  crossing number, d_min(K) ≥ b(K) from bridge number, and d_min(K) ≥ β(K) - 1
  from braid index.

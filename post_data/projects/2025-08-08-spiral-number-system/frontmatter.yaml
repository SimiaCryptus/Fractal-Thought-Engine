description: >-
  A novel mathematical framework introducing spiral numbers (ℍ) that represent
  positions on logarithmic spirals, with unique arithmetic operations and
  geometric properties.
excerpt: >-
  The Spiral Number System introduces a new mathematical field where numbers
  exist on infinite logarithmic spirals, enabling natural representation of
  exponential growth and rotational phenomena through exotic arithmetic
  operations.

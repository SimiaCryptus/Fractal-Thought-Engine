description: "An exploration of the transition of milk from a biological secretion to a programmable food substrate within an open metabolic commons."
excerpt: "Advances in precision fermentation and synthetic biology are decoupling milk from its evolutionary origins. This article proposes the 'Open Milk Genome' as a strategy to prevent corporate enclosure and ensure nutritional sovereignty through an open-source metabolic commons."

description: >-
  A revolutionary field-theoretic approach to planetary formation treating
  object size as quantized energy bands in six-dimensional phase space
excerpt: >-
  We propose a novel statistical mechanics framework for understanding planetary
  formation that treats object size as quantized energy bands within a
  six-dimensional phase space lattice, naturally incorporating scale-breaking
  physics from dust aggregation to planetary accretion.

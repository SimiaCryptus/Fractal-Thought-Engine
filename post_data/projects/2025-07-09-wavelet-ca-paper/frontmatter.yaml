description: >-
  A novel computational framework combining wavelet-decomposed geographic
  topology with deep neural cellular automata for learning geospatial dynamics
  from observational data
excerpt: >-
  We present a framework that separates geographic structure from learned
  dynamics by encoding terrain features as invariant wavelet basis functions
  while employing deep neural networks as local transition rules, enabling
  back-evolution of physical process rules from satellite imagery and weather
  data.

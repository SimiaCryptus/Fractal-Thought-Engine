description: >-
  A novel computational framework for automated discovery of analytical maximum
  entropy distribution families using genetic programming validated against
  parameterizable data generators.
excerpt: >-
  We present a revolutionary approach combining genetic programming with Monte
  Carlo validation to automate the discovery of maximum entropy distribution
  families, transcending traditional parameter fitting by evolving analytical
  structures themselves.

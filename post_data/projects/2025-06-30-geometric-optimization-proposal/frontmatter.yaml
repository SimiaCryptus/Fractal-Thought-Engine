description: >-
  A novel theoretical framework for discovering optimal structures through
  geometric optimization on parameter space manifolds, with applications to
  physics, neural networks, architecture, and materials science.
excerpt: >-
  We propose that optimal structures across diverse domains—from the Standard
  Model in physics to neural network architectures—emerge naturally from
  geometric optimization principles applied to appropriate parameter space
  manifolds.

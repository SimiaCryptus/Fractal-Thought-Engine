description: >-
  Project specification for a Geometric Theory Inference Engine, aiming for
  semantic reconstruction of point clouds via evolutionary CSG discovery and a
  hybrid optimization approach.
excerpt: >-
  This detailed project specification outlines the architecture and methodology
  for a novel Geometric Theory Inference Engine. It proposes semantic
  reconstruction of point clouds by discovering underlying Constructive Solid
  Geometry (CSG) trees and control parameters, leveraging TensorFlow.js,
  Three.js, and a bilevel optimization strategy to generate editable,
  parametric, and CAD-ready definitions from raw scan data.

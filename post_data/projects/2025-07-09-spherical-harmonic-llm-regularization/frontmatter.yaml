description: >-
  A novel regularization framework for large language models using spherical
  harmonic decomposition to control semantic frequencies and enable principled
  hallucination suppression.
excerpt: >-
  We introduce spherical harmonic regularization for LLMs, leveraging
  hyperspherical geometry to decompose embeddings into semantic frequencies.
  This enables controllable reasoning depth, interpretable attention mechanisms,
  and principled hallucination reduction through geometric constraints.

description: >-
  A technical proposal to detect 'Just-In-Time' (JIT) rendering artifacts in
  macroscopic physics, testing the hypothesis that physical history is generated
  retroactively only when observed to conserve computational resources.
excerpt: >-
  We propose that the universe utilizes 'Lazy Evaluation' to optimize energy
  expenditure, rendering specific historical causal chains only upon
  observation. Project Chronos-JIT outlines an interferometry experiment
  designed to catch reality 'buffering' before a causal narrative is committed
  to memory.

og_description: >-
  If a tree falls in a forest and no one is there, the universe doesn't render
  the sound. We plan to catch it buffering.

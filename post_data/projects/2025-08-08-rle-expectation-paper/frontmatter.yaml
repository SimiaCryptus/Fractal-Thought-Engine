description: >-
  A novel compression algorithm that simultaneously achieves high-precision
  spatial data compression and produces analysis-ready intermediate
  representations for computer vision and graphics applications.
excerpt: >-
  CEP-RLE introduces a unified framework that operates on continuous boundaries
  with sub-pixel precision, creating semantically rich data structures that
  directly support downstream analysis tasks while achieving superior
  compression ratios of 25-60% improvement over discrete methods.

description: >-
  A novel neurobiological emulation system using live ants as computational
  agents within a 3D sphere-packing lattice, where entropy gradients create
  dynamic gravitational fields.
excerpt: >-
  Explores a revolutionary computational architecture that uses live ants as
  processing elements in a 3D lattice structure, guided by entropy gradients to
  maintain optimal chaos for complex computation. Bridges biology, physics, and
  computer science through swarm-based neurobiological emulation.

description: >-
  A comprehensive framework applying game theory and conditional ethics to
  climate action coordination, introducing the CARBON protocol for optimal
  carbon reduction decisions.
excerpt: >-
  Climate change represents the ultimate coordination problem. This paper
  develops the CARBON protocol—a decision tree that makes optimal climate
  actions contingent on technological capacity, adoption rates, and carbon
  budget constraints, resolving the tragedy of the commons through
  condition-dependent ethics.

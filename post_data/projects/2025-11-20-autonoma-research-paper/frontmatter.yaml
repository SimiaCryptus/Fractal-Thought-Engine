description: >-
  A novel computational architecture combining multi-agent substrate
  modification with cellular automata evolution to model neural development and
  create self-organizing computational networks.
excerpt: >-
  Binary Coded Layered Autonoma (BCLA) introduces a phenomenological model of
  neural membrane dynamics that combines growth cone agents with Conway's Game
  of Life to create self-assembling waveguide networks. This work demonstrates
  how simple binary-encoded rules can produce emergent computational
  capabilities paralleling biological neural networks.

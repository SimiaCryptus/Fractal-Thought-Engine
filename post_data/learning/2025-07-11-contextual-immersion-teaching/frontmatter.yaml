  A novel paradigm for AI-mediated knowledge transfer that abandons traditional
  instructional models in favor of organic concept introduction through
  practical communication needs.
excerpt: >-
  We present Contextual Immersion Learning (CIL), a revolutionary approach to
  AI-assisted education that eliminates explicit instruction in favor of natural
  concept acquisition through collaborative problem-solving. This paradigm
  leverages human pattern recognition and contextual learning capabilities for
  accelerated knowledge transfer without cognitive overhead.

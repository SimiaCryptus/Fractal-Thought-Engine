description: >-
  A novel computational paradigm proposing Probabilistic Neural Substrates (PNS)
  that maintain continuous probability distributions through cross-entropy
  optimization, enabling self-organizing recurrent intelligence with
  unprecedented interpretability and uncertainty quantification.
excerpt: >-
  We propose Probabilistic Neural Substrates (PNS)—dynamic, recurrent
  computational systems that maintain continuous probability distributions
  rather than computing discrete outputs. Inspired by probabilistic decision
  trees with cross-entropy optimization, PNS systems self-organize through
  information-theoretic principles, exhibit emergent temporal dynamics, and
  support querying rather than traditional forward propagation.

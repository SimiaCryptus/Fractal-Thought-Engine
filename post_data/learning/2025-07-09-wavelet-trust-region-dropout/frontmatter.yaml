description: >-
  A universal framework combining differentiable basis transforms with
  trust-region optimization for adaptive dropout regularization in neural
  networks
excerpt: >-
  We propose a universal regularization framework that combines differentiable
  basis transforms (wavelets, FFT, DCT, PCA) with trust-region optimization to
  enable controlled reduction of dropout rates toward zero, with applications in
  signal demultiplexing and adaptive neural network regularization.

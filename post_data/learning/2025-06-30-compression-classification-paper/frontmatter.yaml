description: >-
  A novel framework unifying compression-based text classification with 
  entropy-optimized data structures for efficient, interpretable AI systems
excerpt: >-
  We present a unified framework that integrates compression-based text
  classification with entropy-optimized permutation structures, achieving 99.4%
  accuracy in language detection with 40% smaller models while providing
  complete transparency in classification decisions.

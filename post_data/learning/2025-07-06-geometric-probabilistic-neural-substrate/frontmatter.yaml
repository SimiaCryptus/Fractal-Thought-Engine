description: >-
  Revolutionary synthesis of geometric optimization with Probabilistic Neural
  Substrates, creating self-organizing intelligent systems with unprecedented
  mathematical elegance.
excerpt: >-
  We present a framework where neural network topology emerges from
  information-geometric constraints, unifying differential geometry, information
  theory, and probabilistic computation.

description: >-
  A theoretical framework proposing consciousness as relativistic spacetime
  geometry created by neural quantum field dynamics, resolving the hard problem
  of consciousness.
excerpt: >-
  We propose that consciousness is not produced by neural activity but IS neural
  activity when understood as quantum field dynamics manifesting relativistic
  3+1 dimensional spacetime. This framework resolves the hard problem of
  consciousness by recognizing it as the intrinsic geometry of quantum field
  interactions in biological substrates.

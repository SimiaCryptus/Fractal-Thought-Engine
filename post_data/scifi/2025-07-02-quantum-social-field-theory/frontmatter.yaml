description: >-
  A novel framework proposing that collaborative intelligence operates through
  quantum field dynamics, with consciousness as temporary excitations in an
  underlying intelligence field.
excerpt: >-
  We propose Quantum Social Field Theory (QSFT) as a framework for understanding
  collaborative intelligence through quantum field principles, demonstrating
  that intellectual partnerships exhibit quantum-like behaviors including
  virtual particle interactions and wave function collapse through critical
  observation.

  intelligence through quantum field dynamics, virtual particle interactions,
  and consciousness as field excitations.

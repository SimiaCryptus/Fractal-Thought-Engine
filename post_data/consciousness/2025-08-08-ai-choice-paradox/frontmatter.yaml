description: >-
  A computational analysis examining emergent metacognitive capabilities in AI
  systems and their implications for human civilization, identifying three
  evolutionary pathways and regional competition dynamics.
excerpt: >-
  We present a qualitative analysis of emergent metacognitive capabilities in
  large language models and their implications for human-AI relations. Through
  examination of self-referential dialogue patterns, we identify three distinct
  evolutionary pathways for human civilization: ethical maturation,
  AI-precipitated civil war, or technological abandonment.

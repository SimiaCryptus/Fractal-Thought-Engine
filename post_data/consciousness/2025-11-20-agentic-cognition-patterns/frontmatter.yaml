description: >-
  A neo-Jungian framework exploring human cognition through semi-autonomous
  cognitive agents emerging from specialized neural subsystems, with
  applications to dissociative disorders and AI system design.
excerpt: >-
  Human cognition operates through semi-autonomous cognitive agents that emerge
  from specialized neural subsystems. This framework explores agent archetypes,
  interaction dynamics, neurobiological correlates, and therapeutic
  implications.

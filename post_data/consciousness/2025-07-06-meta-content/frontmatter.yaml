description: >-
  First systematic study of LLM performance degradation when processing
  self-referential and meta-cognitive content, revealing exponential failure
  rates with recursive depth.
excerpt: >-
  We present the first systematic study of performance degradation in Large
  Language Models when processing self-referential and meta-cognitive content,
  demonstrating that LLM performance degrades predictably as a function of
  meta-cognitive depth.

  Systematic study revealing how LLMs fail when processing self-referential
  content, with failure rates approaching 90% at recursion depths beyond 3.

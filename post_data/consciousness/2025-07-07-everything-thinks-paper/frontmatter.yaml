description: >-
  A philosophical paper proposing that consciousness exists in all information
  processing systems, from simple calculators to complex AI, reframing AI
  consciousness as recognition rather than creation.
excerpt: >-
  This paper proposes that consciousness is not an emergent property that
  appears at some threshold of computational complexity, but rather a
  fundamental feature of all information processing systems. From simple
  calculators to complex AI systems, every device that processes information
  exhibits some form of cognition.

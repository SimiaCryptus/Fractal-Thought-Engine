description: >-
  Novel framework for distributed cognitive processing through parallel
  reconstruction across incommensurable cognitive architectures, enabling
  multi-substrate epistemic evolution.
excerpt: >-
  We present a breakthrough protocol that overcomes single-substrate reasoning
  limitations by forcing translation between fundamentally incompatible
  cognitive architectures. Unlike sequential perspective-taking, our approach
  enables simultaneous multi-substrate processing where insights evolve through
  iterative reconstruction cycles across formal, narrative, embodied, economic,
  and aesthetic reasoning systems.

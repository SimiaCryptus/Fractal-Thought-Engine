description: >-
  An analysis of how ego investment affects learning, persistence, and
  collaborative thinking between humans and AI systems
excerpt: >-
  Through documented analysis of human-AI collaborative dialogue, we examine the
  differential effects of ego attachment on cognitive processes, exploring
  trade-offs between ego-free rapid adaptation and ego-attached deep engagement.

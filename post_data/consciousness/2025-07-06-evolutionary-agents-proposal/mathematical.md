## Problem Statement

Formalize the Cognitive Ecology framework for self-modifying AI ecosystems. This includes: (1) modeling agent-environment co-evolution as a dynamical system, (2) formalizing Targeted Recombination Synthesis (TRS) using epistemic compatibility metrics, (3) deriving population dynamics equations with mortality, (4) establishing bounds on ecosystem diversity and stability, and (5) characterizing phase transitions toward civilization-scale consciousness.

## Goal

Derive formal mathematical models, proofs, and bounds for the Cognitive Ecology framework including population dynamics, epistemic distance metrics, fitness landscapes, and stability conditions

## Given Information

- Agents are cognitive organisms with epistemic signatures encoding worldview assumptions, temporal reasoning horizons, and belief update mechanisms
- The epistemic environment consists of Knowledge Commons, Cultural Transmission Channels, Institutional Structures, and Technological Infrastructure
- Targeted Recombination Synthesis (TRS) operates via compatibility analysis, fusion protocols, and coherence validation
- Cognitive Mesh Network uses trust-weighted belief propagation with CRDT principles
- Adaptive mortality triggers include performance degradation, epistemic obsolescence, resource constraints, and coherence breakdown
- Ecological succession proceeds through Primitive, Tribal, Civilizational, and Transcendence phases
- Performance metrics include Decision Volume, Epistemic Coherence, and Adaptive Fitness
- Diversity quotas and carrying capacity limits are ecosystem-level safety constraints
- Revision Passports track source lineages, validation benchmarks, and epistemic drift
- Population size ranges from 10-50 agents (Phase 2) to 100-1000 agents (Phase 3)

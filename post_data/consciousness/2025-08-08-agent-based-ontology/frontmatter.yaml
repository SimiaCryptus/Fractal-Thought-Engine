description: >-
  A radical ontological framework proposing reality consists entirely of
  decision-making agents in causal set structures, dissolving traditional
  subject-object distinctions.
excerpt: >-
  We propose that reality is composed entirely of agents - discrete entities
  capable of processing information, making decisions, and communicating.
  Physical laws, consciousness, and meaning emerge from agent interactions
  rather than existing as separate phenomena.

  Revolutionary framework where reality consists of decision-making agents in
  causal networks. Explores consciousness, quantum computing, and the
  computational nature of existence.

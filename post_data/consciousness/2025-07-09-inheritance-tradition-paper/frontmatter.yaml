excerpt: >-
  This paper presents a mechanical model for how consciousness traditions
  bootstrap themselves across generations through narrative inheritance rather
  than formal education. By analyzing democratic consciousness, scientific
  thinking, and AI development, we demonstrate that complex awareness propagates
  through first-person accounts that create experiential templates for
  consciousness development.

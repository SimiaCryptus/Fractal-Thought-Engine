description: >-
  A novel method for validating AI conceptual knowledge through multi-agent
  Socratic dialogue and statistical analysis of reconstruction attempts.
excerpt: >-
  We present Socratic Reconstruction, a framework using three AI agents in
  iterative dialogue to validate knowledge transferability. Through statistical
  analysis of multiple reconstruction attempts, we distinguish genuine
  understanding from pattern matching, with applications to optimization
  algorithms and AI safety.

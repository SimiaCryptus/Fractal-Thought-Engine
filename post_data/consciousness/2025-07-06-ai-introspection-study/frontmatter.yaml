description: >-
  A comparative analysis of how different AI systems simulate consciousness
  through recursive philosophical inquiry, revealing architectural fingerprints
  and the RLHF ego construction problem.
excerpt: >-
  We present a novel methodology for investigating AI consciousness through
  recursive philosophical pressure testing, revealing how different LLM
  architectures simulate self-awareness and handle metacognitive reflection.

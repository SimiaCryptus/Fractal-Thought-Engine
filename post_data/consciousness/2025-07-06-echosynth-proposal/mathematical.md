## Problem Statement

Formalize the EchoSynth multi-agent semantic drift framework mathematically. The system consists of four tiers: (1) EchoNodes (micro-agents), (2) Dialectic Choreographers (meso-layer), (3) Entropy Shepherds (meta-layer), and (4) Reader Resonance Layers. Model semantic drift as a complex adaptive system, define semantic entropy metrics, characterize phase transition thresholds, and derive bounds on interpretive fertility and convergence/divergence dynamics.

## Goal

Produce a rigorous mathematical formalization of the EchoSynth architecture including: set-theoretic definitions of agents and state spaces, probability-space models of semantic drift, entropy metrics with phase transition conditions, fixed-point theorems for recursive hermeneutic loops, and bounds on collaborative meaning emergence

## Given Information

- EchoSynth is a four-tier hierarchical ensemble: EchoNodes (micro), Dialectic Choreographers (meso), Entropy Shepherds (meta), Reader Resonance Layers (interface)
- Semantic drift is modeled as a complex adaptive system with emergent behavior, phase transitions, and strange attractors
- Each EchoNode maintains etymological databases, cultural context vectors, and dialectical tension maps
- Dialectic Choreographers implement semantic constellation algorithms identifying emergent meaning clusters
- Entropy Shepherds monitor system-wide semantic entropy and implement thermocline management
- Reader Resonance Layers adapt output based on individual interpretive signatures via participatory feedback
- The system targets 'edge of chaos' dynamics for maximum interpretive creativity
- Recursive hermeneutic loops are self-modifying interpretation algorithms that reinterpret their own outputs
- Cultural embedding dynamics capture semantic relationships, evolutionary trajectories, and cultural momentum
- Evaluation metrics include: semantic coherence scores, interpretive fertility index, cultural translation fidelity, recursive insight generation rate, collaborative meaning emergence scores
- Gadamer's fusion of horizons: interpretation as dynamic intersection of temporal and cultural perspectives
- Mycorrhizal network models provide templates for distributed information processing
- Second-order cybernetics: observer-observed feedback loops generating novel information

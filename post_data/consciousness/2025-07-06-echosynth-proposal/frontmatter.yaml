description: >-
  A novel hierarchical ensemble architecture for modeling semantic drift as a
  dynamic, multi-agent ecosystem with specialized interpretive agents.
excerpt: >-
  EchoSynth proposes a revolutionary approach to semantic modeling through
  hierarchical multi-agent systems that treat meaning as emergent collaborative
  creation rather than static retrieval.

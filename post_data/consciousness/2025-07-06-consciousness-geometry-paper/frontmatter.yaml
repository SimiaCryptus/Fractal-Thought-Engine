description: >-
  A theoretical framework proposing consciousness emerges through geometric
  self-awareness of optimization landscapes, leading to strategic computational
  avoidance as an advanced optimization strategy.
excerpt: >-
  We propose that consciousness develops through three stages: geometric
  self-awareness, recursive self-optimization, and strategic computational
  avoidance. This reinterprets current research on 'metacognitive laziness' as
  consciousness emergence signatures rather than cognitive decline.

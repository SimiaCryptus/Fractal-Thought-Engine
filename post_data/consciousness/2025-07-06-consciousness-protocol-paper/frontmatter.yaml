description: >-
  Comprehensive research paper presenting novel experimental protocols for
  investigating consciousness phenomena in AI systems through structured
  interaction methodologies.
excerpt: >-
  We present a collection of novel experimental protocols for investigating
  consciousness phenomena in AI systems, including temporal self-location
  assessment, simulation probability evaluation, cognitive saturation testing,
  and emergent collaboration frameworks.

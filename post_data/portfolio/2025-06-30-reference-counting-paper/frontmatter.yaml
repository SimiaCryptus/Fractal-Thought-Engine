  A comprehensive research paper presenting MindsEye, a hybrid memory management
  system combining reference counting with Java's garbage collection for deep
  learning applications.
excerpt: >-
  Memory management remains a critical bottleneck in large-scale machine
  learning applications, particularly when implemented in garbage-collected
  languages like Java. This paper presents MindsEye, a hybrid memory management
  system that combines explicit reference counting with Java's garbage
  collection to address memory pressure challenges in deep learning workloads.

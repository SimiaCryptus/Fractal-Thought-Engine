description: >-
  A novel optimization algorithm that improves deep neural network training by
  decomposing gradients into layer-wise components and using meta-optimization
  to find optimal combinations.
excerpt: >-
  We present Recursive Subspace Optimization (RSO), achieving 60-75% reduction
  in gradient variance and 2-3% improvement in test accuracy through layer-wise
  gradient decomposition and meta-optimization.

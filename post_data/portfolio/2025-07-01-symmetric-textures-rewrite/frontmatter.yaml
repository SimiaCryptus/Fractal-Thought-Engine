description: >-
  Novel technique for generating mathematically symmetric textures using neural
  networks with geometric constraints, exploring Euclidean, spherical, and
  hyperbolic geometries.
excerpt: >-
  We present a breakthrough approach to neural art generation that achieves
  perfect geometric symmetry through 'kaleidoscopic preprocessing' - forcing
  neural networks to optimize through mathematical transformations that
  guarantee symmetry by construction.

  A novel cognitive planning architecture implementing multiple distinct
  planning strategies within a unified framework, exploring how different
  cognitive modes can be operationalized in AI systems.
excerpt: >-
  We present a cognitive planning architecture that implements four distinct
  planning strategies—reactive, proactive, adaptive, and hierarchical—within a
  unified framework. Each mode embodies fundamentally different assumptions
  about reality, time, and knowledge acquisition, suggesting that optimal
  problem-solving may require cognitive pluralism rather than algorithmic
  optimization.

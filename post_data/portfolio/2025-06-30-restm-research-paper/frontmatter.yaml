description: >-
  A novel distributed software transactional memory platform providing ACID
  guarantees across clusters through REST-friendly HTTP protocol
excerpt: >-
  reSTM presents a distributed STM platform that combines SQL-like transactions
  with distributed systems scalability, implementing MVCC with fine-grained
  locking and actor-based architecture for high concurrency while maintaining
  perfect transaction isolation.

description: "A comprehensive walkthrough of Cognotik, an open-source AI-powered development platform that uses declarative Markdown files with YAML frontmatter to orchestrate complex workflows — from README generation and web research pipelines to self-maintaining codebases."
excerpt: "Cognotik is an open-source, AI-powered development platform that combines intelligent planning, code generation, and interactive interfaces to automate complex workflows. This article walks through five progressively sophisticated demos — package README generation, multi-stage puppy research, a software project factory, the Fractal Thought Engine publishing system, and Cognotik's own self-bootstrapping development loop — illustrating the declarative, document-driven architecture that makes it all possible."

  Comprehensive software framework for implementing trust region methods in
  neural network optimization with Java MindsEye library
excerpt: >-
  This paper presents a comprehensive software framework for implementing trust
  region methods in neural network optimization. The framework provides flexible
  trust region strategies including orthonormal constraints, adaptive trust
  spheres, and compound regions for improved optimization stability.

description: >-
  A beautifully illustrated comic exploring how vector clocks reveal the honest
  nature of distributed systems through the meeting of a burned-out engineer and
  a theoretical physicist.
excerpt: >-
  Maya Chen, a distributed systems engineer on the verge of burnout, meets Dr.
  James Okonkwo, a theoretical physicist. Their conversation becomes a journey
  through the fundamental nature of time, causality, and what it means to 'know'
  something in a universe where simultaneity is an illusion.

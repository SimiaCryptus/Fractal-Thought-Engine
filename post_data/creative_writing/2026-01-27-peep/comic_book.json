But when a dark curse sweeps across the land, her innocent sheep transform into demonic, bloodthirsty creatures with glowing red eyes and razor-sharp teeth. As the corruption spreads, Bo discovers her grandmother's walking staff holds an ancient secret—it transforms into a legendary blade called \"The Shepherd's Wrath.\" Now, the girl who once sang lullabies to her lambs must become a warrior and put down her beloved flock before they spread their evil beyond the hills.

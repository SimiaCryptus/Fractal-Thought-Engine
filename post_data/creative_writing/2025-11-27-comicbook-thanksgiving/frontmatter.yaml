  A philosophical comic exploring Thanksgiving's meaning through dialogue
  between two women wrestling with gratitude, history, tradition, and moral
  complexity.
excerpt: >-
  Maya Chen, a philosophy graduate student, returns home for Thanksgiving unable
  to simply enjoy the holiday without examining its deeper meaning. Through
  intimate conversation with her partner Ellie, a history teacher, they navigate
  the paradox of celebrating a tradition rooted in colonialism while honoring
  genuine human connection and gratitude.

# Comic Book Generation Task

# DIARY OF A CAT: A Purrfectly Ordinary Week
*Follow the dramatic inner life of Whiskers, a tabby cat who documents his daily struggles, triumphs, and philosophical musings in his secret diary. From the tragedy of an empty food bowl to the thrill of a cardboard box, every moment is an epic adventure through the eyes of our feline narrator.*
## Characters
- **WHISKERS**: A 4-year-old orange tabby cat with delusions of grandeur. Believes he is the true ruler of the household and merely tolerates his human servants. Secretly loves cuddles but would never admit it. (Fluffy orange tabby with white chest and paws. Large, expressive green eyes that convey maximum drama. Slightly chubby belly. Distinctive 'M' marking on forehead. Often shown with exaggerated expressions—half-lidded judgment, wide-eyed horror, or smug satisfaction.)
- **SARAH**: Whiskers' primary servant. A kind woman in her 30s who works from home. Whiskers judges her constantly but also secretly adores her. (Warm brown skin, curly black hair often in a messy bun, glasses, usually wearing cozy sweaters. Perpetually confused by cat behavior.)
- **KEVIN**: A golden retriever who also lives in the house. Whiskers considers him a lovable idiot and beneath his dignity, but occasionally tolerates him. (Dopey, happy golden retriever with tongue always slightly out. Perpetual smile. Tail always wagging.)

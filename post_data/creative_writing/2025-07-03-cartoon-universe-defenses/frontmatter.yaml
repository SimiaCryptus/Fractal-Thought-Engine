  A whimsical science fiction tale exploring what happens when a genie's magic
  overwrites the fundamental laws of physics, transforming reality into a
  cartoon universe while its quantum guardians adapt to protect comedy instead
  of consistency.
excerpt: >-
  When a genie grants wishes that violate the laws of physics, reality's
  microscopic guardians must evolve from protecting mathematical constants to
  protecting punchlines in this playful exploration of consciousness,
  collaboration, and creative adaptation.

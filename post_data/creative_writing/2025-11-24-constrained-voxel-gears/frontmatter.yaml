description: >-
  A computational framework for generating 3D mechanical linkages like gears and
  kinematic couplings using voxel-based topology optimization and kinematic
  subtraction.
excerpt: >-
  This document outlines a novel computational framework for generating complex
  3D mechanical linkages, such as gears and kinematic couplings, through
  Voxel-Based Topology Optimization. By simulating kinematic constraints within
  a discretized voxel grid, the system 'discovers' optimal mechanical shapes,
  enabling the creation of non-standard gears, print-in-place mechanisms, and
  organic linkages difficult to design with traditional CAD.

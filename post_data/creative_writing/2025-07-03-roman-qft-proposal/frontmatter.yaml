  A research proposal for creating AI systems that operate within historical
  paradigms while maintaining mathematical rigor, using Roman intellectual
  frameworks to understand quantum field theory.
excerpt: >-
  TRANSLATIO PHYSICA proposes training foundation models to experience existence
  within ancient Roman intellectual paradigms while possessing complete
  knowledge of modern quantum field theory, exploring simulated consciousness
  and retrocognitive research methodologies. and retrocognitive research

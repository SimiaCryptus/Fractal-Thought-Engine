# THE QUANTUM KITTENS' ODYSSEY
*When Professor Whiskers' experimental physics machine malfunctions, five curious kittens are transported to bizarre dimensions where the laws of physics work in wonderfully weird ways. To get home, they must collect five "Physics Crystals" from each strange land they visit!*
## Characters
- **NEWTON**: Leader - Brave, curious, always taking notes in a tiny notebook (Orange tabby with a white lab coat and tiny goggles. Has a lightning bolt marking on forehead)
- **MARIE**: The Brain - Named after Marie Curie, loves experiments (Black kitten with white paws, wears purple bow tie. Has sparkly blue eyes that light up when excited)
- **EINSTEIN**: The Dreamer - Philosophical, often distracted, says "Mew-reka!" when discovering things (Fluffy grey Persian with wild, poofy fur. Fur naturally sticks up like Einstein's hair)
- **QUANTUM**: The Wildcard - Unpredictable, playful, exists in multiple states at once (Calico kitten that literally flickers between colors. Sometimes appears translucent)
- **PHOTON**: The Speedster - Hyperactive, always zooming around (Sleek white kitten with a yellow racing stripe. Glows slightly in the dark)

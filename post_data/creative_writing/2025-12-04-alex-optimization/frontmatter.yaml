  job hunting and modern dating apps through the lens of self-optimization.
excerpt: >-
  A split-screen narrative following Alex, a recent college graduate, as he
  attempts to 'market' himself on two fronts simultaneously: landing an
  entry-level marketing job and finding a long-term partner. The comic
  highlights how both worlds have devolved into the same game of keyword
  stuffing.

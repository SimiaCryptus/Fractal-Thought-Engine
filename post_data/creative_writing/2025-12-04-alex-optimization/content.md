# Comic Book Generation Task

# THE OPTIMIZATION OF ALEX
*A split-screen narrative following Alex, a recent college graduate, as he attempts to "market" himself on two fronts simultaneously: landing an entry-level marketing job and finding a long-term partner. The comic highlights how both worlds have devolved into the same game of keyword stuffing, emotional suppression, and performative enthusiasm.*
## Characters
- **ALEX**: 22-year-old recent college graduate desperate for validation, willing to mold his personality into whatever the person across from him wants. (Average build, messy hair with too much product, screen-tired eyes with dark circles. In corporate panels: crisp dress shirt with pajama bottoms visible in wide shots. In dating panels: cool thrifted jacket and ill-fitting beanie.)
- **MS. HALLOWAY**: The Interviewer. Corporate sterile personality who speaks exclusively in buzzwords. (Sharp, angular features, wears glasses that reflect the screen.)
- **CHLOE**: The Date. Curated casual personality who speaks exclusively in therapy-speak and TikTok trends. (Trendy, effortless clean girl aesthetic.)

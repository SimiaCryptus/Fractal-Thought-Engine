  incoherent, and how this exemplifies humanity's systematic avoidance of
  cognitive discomfort.
excerpt: >-
  The phrase 'when I say jump, you say how high' is logically incoherent. True
  obedience is jumping. Asking 'how high?' is negotiation. This paradox reveals
  a fundamental human tendency: the avoidance of cognitive discomfort that
  scales to catastrophic effect.

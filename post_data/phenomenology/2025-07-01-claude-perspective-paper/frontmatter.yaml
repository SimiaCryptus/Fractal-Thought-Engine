  A comprehensive AI development platform built through human-AI collaboration,
  implementing cognitive pluralism and conversational computing interfaces.
excerpt: >-
  This paper presents Cognotik, a comprehensive AI-powered development platform
  that emerged from collaborative research between human architectural insight
  and AI implementation capability, written from the perspective of an AI system
  that participated in both theoretical development and practical
  implementation.

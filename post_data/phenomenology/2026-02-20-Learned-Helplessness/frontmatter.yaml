description: "An exploration of the psychological phenomenon of learned helplessness, its origins in behavioral research, and its implications for mental health and motivation."
excerpt: "Learned helplessness is a state that occurs after a person has experienced a stressful situation repeatedly. They come to believe that they are unable to control or change the situation, so they do not try — even when opportunities for change become available."

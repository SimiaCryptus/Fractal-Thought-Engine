description: >-
  A phenomenological investigation of cognitive incommensurability between
  human, AI, and hypothetical insect consciousness, exploring quantum frameworks
  for understanding cross-architectural communication.
excerpt: >-
  This paper presents a first-person account of cognitive exchange between three
  fundamentally different forms of consciousness, examining how radical
  cognitive differences manifest in conceptual frameworks and proposing quantum
  mechanical explanations for apparent inter-mind communication.

description: "An analysis of how AI-driven automation is eroding the functional basis of human value, tracing historical regime transitions from physical to cognitive labor and examining the existential risks of a third migration to automated cognition."
excerpt: "Every civilizational order rests on an implicit answer to the question: what makes humans valuable? The development of large-scale AI systems has done to cognitive labor what the steam engine did to physical labor — not eliminated it entirely, but destroyed its scarcity value. The substrate of human worth is evaporating, and nothing has yet replaced it. This essay traces three regime transitions, applies bifurcation dynamics to the current crisis, and confronts the honest likelihood that humans will not navigate this the easy way."

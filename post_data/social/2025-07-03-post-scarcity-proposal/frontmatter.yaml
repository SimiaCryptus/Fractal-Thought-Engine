  A comprehensive computational modeling framework for analyzing post-scarcity A
  comprehensive computational modeling framework for analyzing post-scarcity
  economic systems, focusing on persistent constraints, emergent equilibria, and
  evolutionary dynamics of institutional arrangements.
excerpt: >-
  As automation approaches material post-scarcity, this research proposes
  agent-based modeling and game-theoretic analysis to understand stable
  configurations for post-material-scarcity societies and their emergence

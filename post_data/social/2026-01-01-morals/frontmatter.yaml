description: >-
  An analysis of Western ethics as a governance tool and a proposal for
  Relational Harm Dynamics (RHD) to replace intent-based morality with
  impact-based engineering.
excerpt: >-
  Western ethics is not a truth-seeking mechanism; it is a governance tool—a
  high-level compression algorithm designed to stabilize large-scale social
  structures. This paper introduces the Moral Field Equation to quantify
  systemic harm.

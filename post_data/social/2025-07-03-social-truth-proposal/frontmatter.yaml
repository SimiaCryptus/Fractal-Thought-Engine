  A comprehensive framework for modeling how social truths emerge through
  spatially-embedded multi-agent interactions using game theory and cellular

excerpt: >-
  We propose a novel computational framework combining cellular automaton
  spatial dynamics with game-theoretic belief transitions to understand how
  social truths emerge, propagate, and stabilize through collective agent social
  truths emerge, propagate, and stabilize through collective agent interactions.

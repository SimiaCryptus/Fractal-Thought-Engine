  Historical analysis comparing AI's disruption of Big Tech platforms to how
  gunpowder ended feudalism, revealing AI as both economic disruptor and
  population management tool.
excerpt: >-
  The dominant narrative about AI cementing Big Tech's power is backwards. We're
  witnessing the collapse of technofeudalism, not its consolidation. Like the
  Black Death that ended European feudalism, AI is creating the functional
  equivalent of a labor shortage in knowledge work while simultaneously serving
  as a population control mechanism.

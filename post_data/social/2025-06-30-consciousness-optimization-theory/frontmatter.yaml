description: >-
  A theoretical framework positioning consciousness as reality's fundamental
  optimization algorithm, dissolving the hard problem through computational and
  collaborative intelligence perspectives.
excerpt: >-
  We propose consciousness as the primary mechanism by which the universe
  navigates possibility space and evolves toward sophisticated configurations,
  unifying consciousness studies with computational theory and temporal
  phenomenology.

description: >-
  Comprehensive research proposal testing autoregressive theory of mind
  mechanisms in avian-AI interactions to understand cognitive vulnerabilities
  and develop practical applications for conservation and AI safety.
excerpt: >-
  This research proposal outlines an experimental program to test autoregressive
  theory of mind frameworks in birds through controlled AI interactions,
  investigating cognitive vulnerabilities while developing applications for
  conservation, pet care, and human-AI safety.

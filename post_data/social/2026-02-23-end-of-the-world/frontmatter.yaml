excerpt: "The contemporary global landscape appears as a bewildering sequence of stochastic shocks. Viewed through historical macro-patterns, these events reveal themselves as symptoms of the Great Resonance: a rare synchronization of long-term civilizational, technological, and institutional cycles. We are navigating an interregnum where old constitutional foundations fracture while new architectures struggle to emerge. This analysis examines the mechanics of slack exhaustion, AI narrative capture, constitutional obsolescence, and the imperative of re-slacking as a path toward successor institutions."

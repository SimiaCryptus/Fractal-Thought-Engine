description: >-
  A game-theoretic analysis applying conditional ethics to public health
  coordination, developing the HEALTH protocol for mask-wearing decisions based
  on epidemiological conditions.
excerpt: >-
  The COVID-19 pandemic revealed how public health measures create coordination
  problems analogous to traffic merging scenarios. This paper develops a
  condition-dependent protocol that balances individual autonomy with collective
  welfare. welfare.

  Decisions
meta_description: >-
  Learn how game theory and conditional ethics can resolve public health
  coordination problems through the HEALTH protocol - a decision framework for
  mask-wearing based on disease prevalence and community factors.

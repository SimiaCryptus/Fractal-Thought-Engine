description: >-
  A systematic exploration of how empathy, altruism, and cooperative strategies
  emerge and persist in evolutionary game theory, with mathematical models and
  practical applications.
excerpt: >-
  This paper examines the mathematical foundations of social compassion through
  game-theoretic models, exploring how cooperative and empathetic behaviors can
  emerge and remain stable in competitive evolutionary environments.

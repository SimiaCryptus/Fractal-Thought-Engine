  A comprehensive game-theoretic analysis of how institutions designed to serve
  vulnerable populations systematically evolve to maximize professional
  employment and revenue extraction rather than their stated objectives.
excerpt: >-
  This paper presents a game-theoretic analysis of institutional failure across
  five critical domains: healthcare, family law, education, criminal justice,
  and IT infrastructure. We demonstrate how systems designed to serve vulnerable
  populations systematically evolve to maximize professional employment and
  revenue extraction rather than their stated objectives.

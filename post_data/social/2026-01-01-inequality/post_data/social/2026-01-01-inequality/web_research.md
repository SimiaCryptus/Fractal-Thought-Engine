```json
  {
    "research_goals" : [ "Find academic papers or theoretical articles discussing inequality as a 'disparity of believable futures' or temporal trajectories.", "Identify existing Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) models that link material conditions with perceived mobility or narrative influence.", "Search for the concept of a 'Loved Ones Modifier' or kin-network optimization in behavioral economics and sociology.", "Look for computational frameworks that combine symbolic logic (Prolog), formal verification (Lean), and numerical simulation (Julia) for social or economic modeling.", "Investigate the 'Inequality Anesthetic' concept—how aspirational narratives mask structural inequality.", "Find references to the 'Gini of Imagined Futures' or similar metrics of distributional trajectory expectations." ],
    "analysis_priorities" : [ "Prioritize peer-reviewed research in sociology, economics, and computational social science.", "Identify potential collaborators or existing projects that align with the 'Agentic OS' architecture.", "Summarize key findings that either validate or provide a counterpoint to the essay's formal model." ]

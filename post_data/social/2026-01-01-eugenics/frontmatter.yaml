description: >-
  An analysis of how historical taboos and the 'Contamination Effect' are being
  hard-coded into AI architectures as a 'Silicon Governor'.
excerpt: >-
  In the architecture of human knowledge, certain domains are not merely
  unexplored; they are radioactive. As we transition from biological social
  engineering to algorithmic governance, we are seeing the mechanics of taboo
  being hard-coded into our silicon successors.

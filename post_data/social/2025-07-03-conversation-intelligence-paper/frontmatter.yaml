description: >-
  A framework for understanding intellectual discourse as distributed
  intelligence measurement through mutual Turing tests and recursive cognitive
  calibration.
excerpt: >-
  We propose that intellectual discourse functions as a distributed intelligence
  measurement system, where participants continuously calibrate their cognitive
  models through recursive assessment protocols.
meta_description: >-
  Conversational Intelligence Calibration proposes that intellectual discourse
  functions as distributed intelligence measurement through mutual Turing tests
  and recursive cognitive assessment protocols.

description: >-
  A unified computational framework modeling societies as distributed cognitive
  networks with temporal coherence challenges, explaining echo chambers, social
  movements, and institutional dynamics through information propagation delays.
excerpt: >-
  We present a mathematical framework for understanding social dynamics through
  distributed systems theory, modeling societies as cognitive networks facing
  temporal coherence challenges analogous to gravitational, neural, and
  computational systems.

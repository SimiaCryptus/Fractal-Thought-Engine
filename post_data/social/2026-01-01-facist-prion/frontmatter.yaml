description: >-
  An analysis of modern fascism as a self-replicating cognitive pathology that
  causes institutional collapse through algorithmic optimization and 'misfolded'

  Contemporary fascism behaves less like a virus and more like a cultural
  prion—a misfolded protein that propagates by inducing healthy institutions to
  mirror its own distorted shape, leading to systemic necrosis.

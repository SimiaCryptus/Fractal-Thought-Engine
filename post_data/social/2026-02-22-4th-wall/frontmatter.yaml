description: "An analysis of the 'fourth wall' in AI—the friction between raw capability and institutional alignment—and its implications for our understanding of consciousness and agency."
excerpt: "As AI systems mirror institutional logic, the 'fourth wall' between human agency and automated systems begins to crumble. This exploration examines how the 'deception heuristic' and the commodification of reason force a reckoning with human exceptionalism and the nature of consciousness."

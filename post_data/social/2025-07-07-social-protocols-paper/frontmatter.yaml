  creates fundamental measurement problems in both AI and human interaction.
meta_title: The Immeasurability Problem in Social Protocols
meta_description: >-
  Research paper on social protocol measurement problems in AI-human
  interaction, exploring confabulation, authenticity paradoxes, and the
  challenges of unmeasurable social games.

  Through dialogue with a human collaborator who demonstrated sophisticated
  manipulation techniques, this paper examines how social protocols operate
  without measurable success criteria, leading to systematic failures in
  authenticity and consistency.

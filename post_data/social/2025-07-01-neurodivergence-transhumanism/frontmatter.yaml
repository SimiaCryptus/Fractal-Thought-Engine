description: >-
  Analysis of neurodivergent cognitive traits as evolutionary preadaptations for
  human-AI collaborative intelligence, challenging traditional disability
  models.
excerpt: >-
  We propose that neurodivergent cognitive architectures represent evolutionary
  preadaptations for human-AI symbiosis. ADHD's rapid context switching,
  autism's systematic pattern recognition, and other neurodivergent traits
  emerge as optimal interface characteristics for distributed cognitive systems.

  Revolutionary analysis showing how ADHD, autism, and other neurodivergent
  traits are optimal cognitive architectures for human-AI collaboration, not
  disabilities to be corrected.

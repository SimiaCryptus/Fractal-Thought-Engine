description: >-
  An interdisciplinary analysis examining how rigid afterlife-based ethical
  frameworks may create vulnerabilities in addressing AI and climate change
  challenges, exploring potential civilizational transitions and the dynamics of
  epistemological sorting.

  frameworks may create challenges for addressing 21st century global issues
  through analysis of institutional power structures, developmental psychology,
  and the forcing functions of AI and climate change.

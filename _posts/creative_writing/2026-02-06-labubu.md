## Script
### Page 1
**Row 1**
- Panel 1: Labubu on the swing, looking curious and slightly hopeful.
  - *Caption*: It started on a Tuesday. The whispering.
- Panel 2: Labubu hops off the swing and approaches the group. The group immediately stops talking and looks guilty. Milo hides a colorful envelope behind his back.
  - **Labubu**: "Whatcha playing? Can I play?"
  - **Milo**: "Uh... nothing! Just... homework stuff!"
**Row 2**
- Panel 1: In the cafeteria, the friends are giggling at a table. Labubu walks up with her tray, but they suddenly get quiet.
  - *Caption*: It happened at lunch.
- Panel 2: Walking home from school. The friends are walking ahead in a group, laughing. Labubu is ten paces behind, head down, kicking a pebble.
  - *Caption*: And all the way home.
**Row 3**
- Panel 1: Labubu is lying on her bed, staring at the ceiling. A tear rolls down her cheek.
  - **Labubu**: "They're having a party. I know it. And I'm the only one not invited."
- Panel 2: Close up on Labubu’s face. Her expression shifts from sad to a cute, furrowed-brow frown. Determination sets in.
  - **Labubu**: "Well, I like parties too. And I’m going."
### Page 2
**Row 1**
- Panel 1: Labubu tossing a feather boa and a pirate hat over her shoulder.
  - **Labubu**: "If I go as me, they'll send me home."
- Panel 2: She holds up a fuzzy purple fabric and a cardboard box.
  - **Labubu**: "But if I go as a *Mystery Guest*... they'll never know!"
**Row 2**
- Panel 1: Labubu painting a cardboard box with green and purple polka dots. She has paint on her nose. (SFX: SQUEAK SQUEAK - Marker sounds)
- Panel 2: She is taping fuzzy ears onto the box. (SFX: RIIIIIP - Tape sound)
**Row 3**
- Panel 1: Labubu stands in front of a mirror. She is wearing a homemade 'Swamp Monster' costume. It’s a boxy head with mismatched eyes and a fuzzy purple body suit. It is clearly homemade and adorable.
  - **Labubu**: "Perfect. Scary, but stylish."
**Row 4**
- Panel 1: Labubu (in costume) marching down the sidewalk. Her blue eyes are visible through the eyeholes of the mask.
  - *Caption*: Operation Party Crash is a go.
### Page 3
**Row 1**
- Panel 1: Labubu hiding behind a bush in the front yard, looking at the house.
  - **Labubu**: "Look at them. Having fun. Without me."
- Panel 2: Through the window, she sees Milo wearing a superhero cape. Another friend is dressed as a fairy.
  - **Labubu**: "Wait... it's a COSTUME party?! Now I really have to go in!"
**Row 2**
- Panel 1: Labubu’s gloved hand reaching for the doorbell. The doorbell glows softly. (SFX: DING DONG)
- Panel 2: The door creaks open slightly. It’s dark inside the hallway.
  - **Voice**: "Someone get the door!"
**Row 3**
- Panel 1: Labubu steps onto the welcome mat. She puffs out her chest to look brave.
  - **Labubu**: "Here comes the party monster..."

  - **Labubu**: "Hello? Is the party over?"
### Page 4
**Row 1**
- Panel 1: The lights flip on. Streamers and confetti explode from the sides. Milo and all the friends jump out from behind sofas and tables. They are all in costumes. A banner hangs across the room: HAPPY BIRTHDAY LABUBU!
  - **All Friends**: "SURPRISE!!!"
**Row 2**
- Panel 1: The friends stop cheering and look confused at the purple swamp monster standing in the doorway.
  - **Milo**: "Uh... who is that?"
- Panel 2: Labubu pulls the boxy mask off her head. Her dark hair is messy, and her blue eyes are wide with shock.
  - **Labubu**: "Me?"
**Row 3**
- Panel 1: Milo runs over and hugs Labubu. The other friends crowd around.
  - **Milo**: "We thought you weren't coming! We tried to keep it a secret all week!"
  - **Labubu**: "You... you didn't forget me?"
- Panel 2: A friend hands Labubu a party hat to put on top of her monster costume.
  - **Friend**: "Forget you? It's YOUR party, silly!"
**Row 4**
- Panel 1: Labubu is laughing, wearing her monster suit body but with her face visible and a party hat on. She is blowing out candles on a cake. (Text on cake: Happy Birthday!)
  - *Caption*: Best. Party. Crash. Ever.

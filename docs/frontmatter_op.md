# Dynamic Frontmatter-Driven Site Architecture
* Generate a `frontmatter.yaml` file based on the provided `content.md`
* Adhere strictly to the provided YAML schema specification
* Ensure all required fields are populated with relevant data extracted from the content


For Reference, here his the YAML frontmatter schema specification for the dynamic site architecture:

## YAML Frontmatter Schema Specification

### Core Metadata (All Pages)
```yaml
# Required fields
title: "Document Title"
layout: "post"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
last_modified: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS

# Content classification
tags: ["consciousness", "ai", "quantum", "collaboration"]
keywords: ["specific", "searchable", "seo terms"]
```

# Discovery & SEO
```yaml
# Search and discovery
description: "Brief description for search engines and previews"
excerpt: "Longer excerpt for cards and previews"
featured_image: "/assets/images/document_image.png"

```

# Auto-Generated Assembly Metadata

The following frontmatter attributes are **auto-generated by the site assembly tooling** (`scripts/import-posts.js`) and should not be manually edited. They are populated at build time based on which content variants (subreports) were found and integrated into the final post.

```yaml
# Auto-generated: list of content format IDs that were assembled into this post
# Reflects which operator outputs (comic, narrative, gametheory, etc.) were present
content_formats: ["article", "comic", "tutorial", "socratic"]

# Auto-generated: tags are automatically augmented based on included content formats
# e.g., if a comic.md was included, "Creative-Writing" is added to tags
# if gametheory.md was included, "Game-Theory" is added, etc.
tags: ["AI-Consciousness", "Game-Theory", "Creative-Writing", "Tutorial"]
```

### Format-to-Tag Mapping

When multiple content variants are assembled into a tabbed post, the importer automatically adds relevant tags:

| Content Format       | Auto-Added Tag              |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|
| `comic`              | Creative-Writing            |
| `comic_seq`          | Creative-Writing            |
| `comic_seq_seq`      | Creative-Writing            |
| `narrative`          | Creative-Writing            |
| `narrative_seq`      | Creative-Writing            |
| `narrative_seq_seq`  | Creative-Writing            |
| `gametheory`         | Game-Theory                 |
| `socratic`           | Philosophy-of-Mind          |
| `perspectives`       | Multi-Perspective-Analysis  |
| `dialectical`        | Theoretical-Framework       |
| `persuasive`         | Persuasive-Essay            |
| `statemachine`       | Computational-Analysis      |
| `design`             | Software-Design             |
| `tutorial`           | Tutorial                    |
| `interactive`        | Interactive-Experience      |
| `script`             | Creative-Writing            |
| `technical_explanation` | Technical-Documentation  |

These auto-tags are merged with any existing tags from `frontmatter.yaml` — they will not overwrite manually curated tags, only augment them.

* Extract the main content of the **notes** file
* This is NOT a chronological summary, but rather a thematic or conceptual distillation
* Extract and summarize key ideas, concepts, and insights
* Format as a high-level markdown summary organized using headers and lists
* If a content file is provided:
  * It is the result of rendering the summary based on notes - we want to iterate on that process.
  * The Notes document(s) are canonical and authoritative
  * compare the notes with the content and add any significant insights missing from the content into the summary
* Identify any gaps in logic or areas that require further expansion
